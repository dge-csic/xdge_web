    <h1><i>DGE</i> online</h1>
	<p><strong><i>DGE</i> online</strong> is the digital edition of the seven published volumes of the <i>Diccionario Griego-Español</i>, that cover the alphabetical section α - ἔξαυος. Although still in progress, the <i>DGE</i> is currently becoming the largest bilingual dictionary of ancient Greek: it already includes about 60,000 entries and 370,000 quotations of ancient authors and texts.</p>
	<p>The <i>DGE</i> is a dictionary of authorities, which means that all the translations and meanings are documented with quotations of literary authors and documentary texts from the Mycenaean period and Homer to the VIth century A.C. Our work is based on an extensive collection of lexical materials, still increasing because of the constant publication of new literary and documentary texts, new critical editions and lexical studies, to which must be added the databases of ancient Greek corpora. For further information about the history and the characteristics of the <i>DGE</i>, please visit our <a href="../../hist.en" target="_new">Project Presentation</a>.
	</p>
	<p>This new digital resource is a first version of <i>DGE</i> online, to be followed by others. The text has been encoded in XML validated by a schema following the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml" target="_new">TEI P5</a>). The lemmas are displayed in a dual navigation system (in alphabetical order or reverse) that allows quick and efficient access to the entries. The articles are displayed one by one in a structured view. The main sections are clearly separated, which is yet a significant advance in comparison with the condensed and tight presentation of the printed Lexicon.

	<p>In order to discover some of the future features of <i>DGE</i> online, we encourage you to consult <strong><a href="http://dge.cchs.csic.es/lmpg/" target="_new" class="variant"><i>LMPG</i> online</a></strong>, the digital edition of the <i>Léxico de magia y religión en los papiros mágicos griegos</i>. Because of its lower degree of complexity, the digitization of this small Lexicon is considered as a successful prototype: it provides some advanced features, such as the implementation of a customized search engine, that will be gradually integrated into <i>DGE</i> online. In order to improve this new resource, we will be glad to read <a href="#" onmouseover="this.href='ma'+'ilto'+'\x3A'+'juan.rodriguez'+'\x40'+'cchs.csic.es'">your comments and suggestions</a>.
